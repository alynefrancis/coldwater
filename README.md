# Project Title

Coldwater Web Design - my personal portfolio

## Theme info

This website is a custom WordPress build. The design was inspired by another theme out there that I liked. 
I purchased the photoshop file and created a mashup between my own design ideas and theirs. 
A work in Progress.

Two critical plugins used in the development of this theme are  

1) Advanced Custom Fields Pro https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/
2) Custom Post Types UI https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/
